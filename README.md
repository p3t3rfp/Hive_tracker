# Hive_tracker

According to <a href='https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apiarist'>this</a> internet document:

'Apiarist is a fancy word for a beekeeper. An apiarist enjoys working with an unusual kind of pet, the honeybee. Because bees and other pollinators are so important to a healthy environment scientists encourage “bee-spotting” to improve fruits and vegetables.'

Hive-tracker is an application for apiarists that want to catalog their hives and track production of their bees.

# Technologies utilized

* Django | rest_framework
* React | styled components
* Python
* PostgreSQL
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

# Second Go-round
* I'd like to incorporate authentication and protect the hives from colony collapse!
* I'd like to research agricultural API's (Data.gov) further to see if I can help to find trends in crop production and pollination needs in our area.

Let's try to help everyone bee happy
